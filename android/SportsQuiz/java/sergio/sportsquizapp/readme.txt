Here are classes I use to create an app:
MainCtivity - activity where you answer questions, choosing next or previous question and able to cheat;
CheatActivity - appears when you pressed "Cheat" button. It's possible to change yours mind - do not cheat - and back to main activity;
TrueFalse - with its help I create Question object that consists of question and answer.
