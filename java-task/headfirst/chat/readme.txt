Here are Server and Client classes that use to provide you kind of messanger.
ClientChat.java - client for this chat with GUI (using Swing to setup it)
ServerChat.java - server for this chat with no GUI, so you need to launch it in another terminal
To start chating:
1) Launch server.jar;
2) Launch whatever amount of clients you need using client.jar;
3) Set each client's name;
4) Chat!
